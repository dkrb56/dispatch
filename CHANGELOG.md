# Changelog

What each update of Dispatch brought, in plain words. The newest version comes first. After an update, Dispatch shows the entries since the version you had before; **?** → **What's new** shows them all. The versions before 0.1.46 are in the git history of the repository.

## 0.1.56 (2026-11-13)
- Each finding of the rules check (Setup pipeline and the Rules window) has a link with the name of its file, also for a rule outside the project. A click shows the file in the viewer.
- In a report or a plan, the files of the line "files:" show as a row of links above the text, and a path in a code span is a link too. A file that is not there marks its link, and the view stays.
- The file viewer is now a dialog above the other windows; Esc closes only the viewer. Its button "Open in editor" opens the shown file in the program of this PC, for a file of this PC.

## 0.1.55 (2026-11-12)
- Setup pipeline has the switch "Task branches": a task works on its own branch, and a Merge card merges it into your branch when you click Merge. A gate command of your choice must pass first.
- Setup pipeline has the switch "Measure before the plan": the plan run may run the commands you list, one at a time, and the plan shows what it measured.
- A window "What's new" opens once after an update and lists what the new versions brought. **?** → **What's new** shows the whole list.
- The worker script has new parts, so Setup pipeline shows the step Worker script as To do once in a project that is set up. Apply it once.

## 0.1.54 (2026-11-12)
- The Environment panel has a switch for Remote Control: a click turns it on or off for the session of the pane, on this PC or on a host.
- The top bar shows "N old sessions" while Claude Code still keeps worker sessions of finished tasks open. Its window lists them, and End closes one session; its task does not change.
- The Plan row of an open task card has no state chip any more, so it no longer looks like a second run.
- The download for macOS contains the host program for both kinds of Mac again.

## 0.1.53 (2026-11-12)
- Work on another computer: a host program does the work on one computer, and the window of another computer shows and controls it over Tailscale. Options → Where the work runs has the modes This PC does the work, Use hosts, and This PC and hosts.
- One window connects to several hosts at once, and a folder chooser picks the project folders of a host.
- The triage chats and the Nightmode switch live on the computer that does the work, so every window sees the same ones.
- A worker question opens a Questions window like the Decisions window. Send the answers sends every answer in one reply.
- The question menus of the triage chat show the right text and every option, also when a menu is taller than the terminal.
- A plan has a short TL;DR in plain words, and the Decisions window shows it under the Goal.
- A task that you approved while its project was busy shows what it waits for.
- While Nightmode is on, the computer that does the work does not go to sleep.
- The bar at the bottom shows the Claude account and when the weekly usage starts again.

## 0.1.52 (2026-11-11)
- Triage that runs only a background command counts as free, so Dispatch sends it the next planned message.
- Changes inside the app prepare the work on another computer; nothing changes for you yet.

## 0.1.51 (2026-11-11)
- The line above the message box of the triage chat says how many messages wait for triage.

## 0.1.50 (2026-11-11)
- Dispatch runs on macOS: each release has a disk image for the Mac next to the Windows installer.
- A task that starts to wait for you alerts you once: a system notification, a short chime and a blinking taskbar button, each with its own switch in the new Options window behind the gear. The lists for the theme and the text size moved there.
- The Overview card shows the tasks in work, the newest finished tasks and the planned messages. A message to triage waits as a planned entry until triage is free, and you set the order of the entries.
- The project cards of the Overview can be dragged. They snap to a dotted grid, and Dispatch keeps their places.
- A report with several questions is answered in one reply, after you chose an option for each question.
- The Decisions window starts with your words from the brief and the Goal of the plan.
- The rules check of the Rules window has its own time limit, model and effort.
- The task files move into the folder .dispatch of the project, so git keeps the briefs, plans and reports. Dispatch commits them itself.
- The Nightmode switch stays on or off over a restart, and the triage chats follow it.
- Both copies of Dispatch on one computer continue the same triage chat.
- A work run that ended with a question stays done when Claude Code marks it as crashed hours later.
- A reload of the page no longer closes the app.
- The Options window takes the height of its content.
- Dispatch has a new app identifier. An update from an older install starts with empty tabs and settings.

## 0.1.49 (2026-11-11)
- The model and effort lists of the Triage and Workers heads stand together at the right edge of the head.
- A temporary task card shows your whole message with its line breaks, up to six lines.
- The Map folds finished tasks again.
- Temporary task cards stay over a restart of Dispatch, for up to 10 minutes after the message.

## 0.1.48 (2026-11-10)
- A message to triage shows at once as a temporary task card. The real card takes its place when the plan run starts.
- A theme list switches the colours of the window and the terminals: Slate, or Graphite with a blue, indigo, teal or amber accent.
- The Overview hides the projects group of the top bar.

## 0.1.47 (2026-11-10)
- Each task shows two short lines: what it is about, and what was done or is in work.
- A running task has a Stop row. Two clicks end its worker.
- The projects group of the top bar shows in every mode.
- The groups of the top bar have a visible frame.

## 0.1.46 (2026-11-10)
- The top bar shows the modes, the projects and the setup as framed groups, and + adds a project.
- The Setup pipeline window has a Commit to git button that commits only the setup files.
- Dispatch checks the rules of a project: Setup pipeline lists the conflicts, and the Rules window has Analyse rules.
- Dispatch keeps the position and size of its window. Project opens Setup pipeline first for a project that is not set up, and the workspace opens after it.
